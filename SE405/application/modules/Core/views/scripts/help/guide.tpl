<div class="terms">
<p align="justify">Welcome to the Momburbia Community Guidelines. We created Momburbia to provide moms with a safe and unique place where they can connect with other moms, share experiences, share challenges, give and get advice, laugh, and do much more.</p><br/>
<p align="justify">These Guidelines are here to help Momburbia be a great place for as many moms as possible! Momburbia is a community where a mom can feel welcome and safe, and not be subjected to personal attacks or disrespectful behavior.</p><br/>
<p align="justify">As the "owner", the Momburbia Team will do our best to enforce the Guidelines of the Community, assist members with any questions, and provide a clean place for moms to spend their time.</p><br/>
<p align="justify"><b>Momburbia Guidelines - Rules of Conduct</b></p><br/>

</ul><br/>
<p align="justify"><b>Momburbia's Responsibilities</b><br/><br/>
The Momburbia Team will not look at every post, photo or comment made on the site nor do we guarantee the integrity of every member on the site. But, if we catch something that we believe violates our Community Guidelines or the Momburbia Terms of Service - because we noticed it or you reported it - we will review the situation and take appropriate action if necessary.
</p><br/>
<p align="justify">When you report something to us that you believe violates these Guidelines or the Momburbia Terms of Service, we will do our best to review it. We will not always agree with you that there is a problem. When we do agree, we will take the action that we feel is appropriate. For privacy reasons, we often will not be able to share the action that we have taken, but we take all reports seriously, and take appropriate actions when necessary. While we listen to our members, we have the final say on whether content or conduct is permissible under these Guidelines and our Terms of Service.</p><br/>
<p align="justify">We always have the right to remove postings, lock postings, warn members, suspend accounts, and/or cancel accounts to enforce these Guidelines or the Momburbia Terms of Service or as we deem necessary to maintain the integrity of the site or our business. Whatever action we choose to take, our decision is final. We will not always explain our actions, but rest assured we do not take these decisions lightly.</p><br/>
<p align="justify">We generally won't take action against older content that violates these Guidelines. We feel our efforts are better spent focusing on current issues on the site.</p><br/>
<p align="justify">If we feel that by removing a post or a member we can make the site experience better for the rest of the members, we will do it. Or, we could decide that a posting that you find objectionable is within the Guidelines. You may not always think our decisions are fair and you may not always agree with us. </p><br/>
<p align="justify"><b>Your Responsibilities</b><br/><br/>
By following these Community Guidelines, you will be doing your part to make Momburbia a great place for all moms to be. In addition, you have Privacy and Security tools to control who sees the content you post. 
</p><br/>
<p align="justify">All Groups must abide by the Momburbia Group Guidelines. Group Owners are responsible for making their own guidelines for the group and enforcing them as desired. Group Owners are able to remove members from their groups. If a Group Owner needs help with an issue that she can't deal with on her own, she should contact us for assistance.</p><br/>
<p align="justify">These Guidelines are a work in progress. We may revise these Guidelines at any time and without prior notice.></p><br/>
<p align="justify"><b>Momburbia Detailed Rules of Conduct </b></p><br/>
<p align="justify"><b>Be respectful of others.</b>
It's the most important thing for everyone on Momburbia. Try not to take things too personally. </p><br/>
<p align="justify"><b>Don't harass, personally attack, or gang up on others. </b>
You can be opinionated and say that your opinion is better or different than another opinion. But don't be nasty about it. Disagree with the opinion, not the person. Don't name-call or try to rally support for your "side".</p><br/>
<p align="justify"><b>Slurs, stereotyping, and hate speech are not tolerated. </b>
Slurs, hate speech and attacks aimed at any race, color, religion, national origin, disability or sexual orientation are not tolerated at all on Momburbia. </p><br/>
<p align="justify"><b>Controversial topics and debate are great, but they should be done constructively. Be prepared for others to agree AND disagree with you and your ideas. </b></p><br/>
<ul>
<li>When you post something, especially about a controversial topic, expect that your viewpoints and opinions may be vigorously questioned, challenged, and held up to scrutiny. If having your opinions challenged and being expected to defend your position will make you uncomfortable, please don't post about that topic
<li>Momburbia tries to be a place where people can express their opinion and practice freedom of speech, even if their message is extremely controversial or of questionable validity. That means that you might feel something is "wrong" and doesn't belong on Momburbia, and we might disagree. We feel that sometimes the best way to defend against ignorant or prejudicial speech is with more speech.  
<li>Discussion and debate are not only allowed, they are encouraged. But, if a healthy discussion breaks down into an exchange of attacks and insults or becomes too heated, we will take measures to end the discussion. If the discussion is happening in a group, it's up to the Group Owner and Admins to remove the offenders, according to the Momburbia Mandatory Group Guidelines and their own group's guidelines.
<li>We are particularly sensitive to members criticizing or attacking the parenting styles or parenting decisions of other members. Use sensitivity when expressing your opinion about the way another member is raising her children.
</ul>
<p align="justify"><b>Use privacy and security settings to control whom you share your posts and photos with</b></p><br/>
<p align="justify">Familiarize yourself with the privacy and security options available to you on Momburbia. </p><br/>
<p align="justify"><b>Don't post something just to inflame or annoy others.</b>Posts that are meant to only upset another mom or group of moms have no place at Momburbia. They simply pollute the air and make it a less inviting place for everyone. Sometimes posts and comments are unintentionally inflammatory - and we understand that - but we might still remove the post or commen</p><br/>

<p align="justify"><b>Don't ask other members for help in the form of money, gifts or donations.</b>We appreciate the stress on you and your family resulting from financial pressures, however, it is not acceptable at this community to ask another member for money, goods or services. Instead, you can suggest that members donate to official.</p><br/>
<p align="justify"><b>Advertising and promotions are allowed ONLY on your profile page, in Classified or in groups that allow advertising. You may not PM or Chat your advertisements to other members unless they specifically request information about it. </b></p><br/>
<ul>Advertising includes:
	<li>Work-at-home businesses
	<li>Products that you are selling (personal or professional)
	<li>Job opportunities
	<li>Charities and charitable causes
	<li>Promoting another website (personal, non-business websites are not advertising)
	<li>Promoting your entry in a contest (e.g,. "vote for my baby in the cutest baby contest on xyz.com!")
</ul>

<p align="justify">Pyramid schemes and cash gifting scams are illegal and posting information about these schemes anywhere on Momburbia is prohibited. In addition, posts soliciting or advertising the availability of children for adoption are not permitted on Momburbia</p><br/>
<p align="justify">There are many things that members are prohibited from listing for sale on Momburbia. Click here to see the list of prohibited or restricted items.</p><br/>
<p align="justify"><b>Be respectful of others when posting any content that is adult in nature. Nude photographs or images are not allowed. Neither are photographs or images of abortion or depictions of violence. </b></p><br/>
<p align="justify">We all have different thresholds for what we are comfortable seeing and reading. In addition, while Momburbia is a site for moms, moms often have their children around! In order to make Momburbia comfortable for everyone, and so any little ones don't see something that they shouldn't, please adhere to the following guidelines when posting content that may not be suitable for everyone.  </p><br/>
<p align="justify">Cursing and adult content are prohibited. </p><br/>
<p align="justify">Nude photographs or images are not allowed, though breastfeeding and birthing photos are permitted as long as they are noted accordingly in the title of the album or photo.  For example, your album title can be "Feeding my Baby Boy"(Nude) The album cover must also be a non-nude image to allow the user to chose if they wish to enter and see nude photos.  Also, if you wish to post an image on your wall or within a group or blog, post a non-nude image and mention that your album is available in the photos section to view and see all photos.</p><br/>
<p align="justify">We also allow "nude" pictures of babies under 6 months old - we don't believe that it's a wise idea to post nude pictures of anyone older than that. </p><br/>
<p align="justify"><b>Don't share your personal information or anyone else's information.</b>
Would you give your phone number, street address or anything else to a mom you just met? Maybe - if you trusted her or knew someone in common. But you probably wouldn't give it out to someone you knew little about. The same is true online. Don't give out your personal information to anyone else unless you're sure it's safe. And, don't give it out in a public area of Momburbia where others can see it too. It will be removed
</p><br/>
<p align="justify">Don't give money to people who ask for it online. While their stories may move you, you have no way of knowing if they are legitimate. We can't verify the identities of everyone on the site and you use the site at your own risk. We urge you to learn and follow best practices for staying safe online.</p><br/>
<p align="justify">You should also not share or post anyone else's personal information. Don't repost messages from private groups or messages in public places. If the information was posted in a private group, assume that the member wants it to remain private.</p><br/>
<p align="justify">We are not responsible for what happens off the site, even if it was organized on Momburbia. Be careful whom you talk to, whom you trust, and what you do in the "real" world based on what you read online</p><br/>
<p align="justify"><b>Do not create multiple accounts on Momburbia.</b></p><br/>
<p align="justify">Each member of Momburbia is allowed to have one account. If you need a second account to manage your Momburbia group, it is usually allowed with permission from the Momburbia Team. If we discover you have multiple Momburbia accounts, we may cancel that account in addition to your original</p><br/>
<p align="justify"><b>Help us keep Momburbia orderly by reporting any problems you see on the site, posts that break these rules, and anyone you suspect doesn't belong on Momburbia.</b></p><br/>
<p align="justify">If you see something, say something to us. We're always on the site in one-way or another. And, we rely on Momburbia members to help us identify when there is a violation of these Guidelines. When you report something to us, we will do our best to investigate it. You don't need to report things multiple times or have your friends also report the same issue. We try to review everything sent to us and sending it multiple times just slows things down for everyone. Use the "report" button or the Contact Us form to send a message to the Momburbia Team from anywhere on the site</p><br/>
<p align="justify">If you think you've found an "imposter" or suspect that a member is not "legitimate," let us know by using the "Contact Us" link at the bottom of each page. We will investigate promptly. Do not threaten, harass or make blog posts about your suspicions. Doing this will only interfere with and slow down our efforts to get to the truth quickly. Likewise, if we discover that you are pretending to be someone you are not, we will cancel your account.</p><br/>
<p align="justify"><b>Don't do anything criminal or illegal on Momburbia or encourage anyone else to do so. </b></p><br/>
<p align="justify">Any postings that we reasonably believe or suspect are criminal or illegal in nature will be removed and any conduct that we suspect is illegal or which poses a threat of illegal activity will be reported to the appropriate authorities. We will cooperate with authorities to prosecute anyone who breaks the law while using our site. Do not link to sites containing criminal or illegal activity</p><br/>
<p align="justify">If you see something that you believe is illegal, you can report that to the authorities. We are not experts, and cannot make assessments about the legality of many things - if you think it's illegal, you should contact the police and let them make the decision. We will fully cooperate with any authorities who contact us about issues on Momburbia</p><br/>
<p align="justify"><b>You may discuss Momburbia's policies, but only in the Momburbia Suggestions and Feedback inside Conversations. </b></p><br/>
<p align="justify">We are open to constructive feedback about our decisions and policies. But in order to keep on top of all of the inquiries, we need everyone to post their policy discussions in the same place.</p><br/>
<p align="justify">We created the Momburbia Group Guidelines to help all group owners, administrators, and members understand how groups are run and regulated on Momburbia.</p><br/>
<b>About Momburbia Groups</b><br/><br/>
	<ul>
