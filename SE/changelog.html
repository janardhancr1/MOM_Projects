<h2>Version 3.00beta/3.01beta/3.02</h2>
<br>
The upgrade to v3.02 involves replacing all of your PHP, TPL, and CSS files. This means that you will lose any changes you have made to these files. Unfortunately there is no easy way to avoid this since we've made so many changes to the platform. If possible, make a note about each change you've made in your current installation so that you can reapply them after the upgrade process.

<h2>Version 2.00</h2>
<br>
The upgrade to 2.00 involves replacing all of your PHP, TPL, and CSS files. This means that you will lose any changes you have made to these files. Unfortunately there is no easy way to avoid this since we've made so many changes to the platform. If possible, make a note about each change you've made in your current installation so that you can reapply them after the upgrade process.
