<h2>SOCIALENGINE 3.10+ UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Please also read the section below that applies to your upgrade</b>
  </li>
  <li>
    Due to changes in the template compiler functions, you MUST clear out the
    contents of "include/smarty/templates_c" when upgrading
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Important!</b> SocialEngine 3.10+ uses PHP sessions to keep track of users' login info 
    (which is more secure than cookies). Unfortunately, the plugin upload pages
    clear out the session data. If the plugin has an upload page, and was
    released before 3.10, you must remove the following 3 lines from these
    files (if you have the corresponding plugins):
    
    <div style='margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 5px;'>
      user_album_upload.php (Albums &lt;=3.04)<br />
      user_blog_album_upload.php (Blogs &lt;=3.03)<br />
      user_event_upload.php (Events &lt;=3.03)<br />
      user_group_upload.php (Groups &lt;=3.03)<br />
      user_music_upload.php (Music &lt;=3.03)<br />
      user_video_upload.php (Videos &lt;=3.01)
    </div>
    <br />
    
    Here are the lines that must be removed:
    <div class="box" style='margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 5px;'>
      session_start();<br />
      $_SESSION = array();<br />
      session_regenerate_id();
    </div>
    <br />
    
    Plugins released after 3.10 of the platform will not need this change.
  </li>
</ol>
<br />



<h2>SOCIALENGINE 3.02+ -> 3.X UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    If you are upgrading from v2.8 or below, please use the instructions further down 
    on this page. Make a COMPLETE BACKUP before you begin.
  </li>
  <li>
    Upload all of the files and folders contained in the "/files" directory in this zip 
    to your server EXCEPT the "/uploads_user" directory. Do not upload install.html, 
    license.html, upgrade.html, changelog.html, or the contents of the "/install" directory. 
    <br />
    - Upload the "/images" and "/include" directories in BINARY mode.
    <br />
    - Upload everything else in ASCII mode.
    <br />
    <div style='padding-left: 50px;'>
      Remember, a file named "index.php" is included with SocialEngine.
      If you already have a homepage with this name, you can choose to
      not upload this file. SocialEngine also comes with an example portal
      page, "home.php", which you can use if desired.
    </div>
    <b>Note:</b> If you have made modifications to your SocialEngine installation, 
    refer to <a href='changelog.html'>changelog.html</a> for a list of files and language
    variables modified in each version. If you have made changes to those files, we suggest using 
    <a href='http://winmerge.org/' target='_blank'>WinMerge</a> to consolidate your changes with the 
    new files.
    <br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>
    Upload the files upgrade.php and upgradesql.php to your server. These files can be found 
    in the "/upgrade" directory in this zip.
    <br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>
    Set full permissions (CHMOD 777) on the "/cache" directory
    <br>Set full permissions (CHMOD 777) on the "/language" directory
    <br>Set full permissions (CHMOD 777) on the "/language/indexes" directory
    <br>Set full permissions (CHMOD 777) on the "/include/smarty/cache" directory
    <br>Set full permissions (CHMOD 777) on the "/include/smarty/templates_c" directory
    <br>Set full permissions (CHMOD 777) on every file inside the "/templates" directory
    <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>
    Point your browser to where you uploaded upgrade.php, for example:
    http://www.yourdomain.com/socialnetwork/upgrade.php<br>
    Follow the instructions given and run the upgrade script.
    <br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>
    Remember to delete "upgrade.php" and "upgradesql.php" after your
    upgrade has completed successfully. Leaving these files intact
    poses a serious security risk!
    <br />
    <br />
  </li>
</ol>
<br />


<h2>SOCIALENGINE 2.X -> 3.X UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    If you are upgrading from v1.8 or below, you will need to upgrade to v2.X before you 
    can upgrade to v3.00+. Make a COMPLETE BACKUP before you begin.
  </li>
  <li>
    The upgrade to 3.00 involves replacing all of your PHP, TPL, and CSS files. This means 
    that you will lose any changes you have made to these files. Unfortunately there is 
    no easy way to avoid this since we've made so many changes to the platform. If possible, 
    make a note about each change you've made in your current installation so that you can 
    reapply them after the upgrade process. Though you will not lose any user data, your users 
    will lose their previous recent actions during the upgrade. Upload all of the files and folders contained 
    in the "/files" directory in this zip to your server EXCEPT the "/uploads_user" and "/uploads_admin" directories. 
    Do not upload install.html, license.html, upgrade.html, changelog.html, or the 
    contents of the "/install" directory. 
    <br />
    - Upload the "/images" and "/include" directories in BINARY mode.
    <br />
    - Upload everything else in ASCII mode.
    <br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>
    Upload the files upgrade.php and upgradesql.php to your SocialEngine root directory on your server. 
    These files can be found in the "/upgrade" directory in this zip.
    <br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>
    Set full permissions (CHMOD 777) on the "/cache" directory<br />
    Set full permissions (CHMOD 777) on the "/language" directory<br />
    Set full permissions (CHMOD 777) on the "/language/indexes" directory<br />
    Set full permissions (CHMOD 777) on the "/include" directory<br />
    Set full permissions (CHMOD 777) on the "/include/smarty/cache" directory<br />

    Set full permissions (CHMOD 777) on the "/uploads_admin" directory.<br />
    Set full permissions (CHMOD 777) on the "/uploads_admin/ads" directory.<br />
    Set full permissions (CHMOD 777) on "/include/database_config.php" (if it exists)<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>
    Point your browser to where you uploaded upgrade.php, for example:
    http://www.yourdomain.com/socialnetwork/upgrade.php<br>
    Follow the instructions given and run the upgrade script.
